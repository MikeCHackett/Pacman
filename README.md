## PacMan

 PacMan-Simulator
PacMan simulator is a fun project I created to show edge detection mechanics and show change of directions.

**What I Learned**
- How to use setInterval() for continuous movement of Pac-Man
- How to implement css and use stop setInterval


## Description
Pac-Man starts to move from left to right with interchanging images.

Once it reaches the right most edge of the screen it changes its direction.
